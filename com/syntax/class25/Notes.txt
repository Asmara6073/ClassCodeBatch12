Method overriding in java"
    Method overriding happens when we have same named methods in parent and child class classes.

Benefits:
    1.flexibility : if we do not like something from the parent class we can override it and can provide our implementation
    2. same method can act differently depending upon the object on which we call it
RULES:
    1.without inheritance method overriding is not possible
    2.Method signature should be same in parent class and in child class
    3.if something does not participate inheritance we can not override it
    constructors and private methods.
    4.we can increase the visibility in the child class, but we can not decrease it .For example, we can go from default
    or protected. But we can not do the reverse
    5.we can not override a static method, but we can redeclare it.For example main method cannot be overridden
    as it is static
    6.we  can not have different return type in the child class it must be same as of parent class.

 OOPS Main Pillars:
    1)Inheritance(code re-usability)
    2)Polymorphism(less code, dynamic code behavior)
    3)Abstraction( )
    4)Encapsulation
