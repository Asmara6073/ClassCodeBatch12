Maps in Java:
   -Map is an interface that allows us to store the data in key value pairs

Benefits of Maps:
    -We can store two values inside the maps
    -Searching is very efficient in maps

Types of Maps
1)HashMap
    -Insertion order is not maintained(downside)
    -Insertion and retrieval speed is the fastest one

2)LinkedHashMap
    -Insertion order is maintained(upside)
    -Insertion speed is the same as HashMap but retrieval speed is the slowest of all maps

3)TreeMap
    -Data is sorted in ascending (natural) order by default
    -Insertion speed is slowest but retrieval speed is better than LinkedHashMap but slower than HashMap

Rules:
-We can't convert a collection to a map for example we can't convert a set to a Map
-Duplicate keys are not allowed in maps
-Duplicate values are allowed
