Abstract classes in java:
    Abstract classes in java are the classes with abstract keyword. we ust abstract classes to achieve abstraction.

Abstraction:
    Is the process of hiding implementation details and only showing the functionality to the end user

Benefits of Abstraction:
    1)Reduces the complexity
    2)Improves the maintainability
    3) Can also enforce rules up to a certain limit

Disadvantages of Abstraction:
    1)classes get tightly coupled



 Rules:
 Abstract classes can have all the things that regular classes do but we can't create their objects
    directly and if a class is inheriting from that the abstract class it must either provide the
    implementation for the abstract method or it must be declared abstract
 1) we can't have final and abstract keywords with a method at the same time
 2) we can't have abstract and static keywords with a method at the same time
 3)abstract keyword with fields is not allowed.

 Interface:
 --Interfaces are also used to achieve abstraction in java we can create an interface with the keyword interface
 -- static methods must have their body
 -- methods are implicitly public and abstract
