Sets in Java:
-Set is an interface in collections framework which is implemented by many classes.
    --HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeHashSet
-Properties of Set:
-All the Sets don't allow duplicates

HashSet:
--Does not maintain the insertion order.
-- It is the fastest in all Sets
-- Most widely used Set

LinkedHashSet:
--Maintains the insertion order
--Slower than HashSet but faster than TreeSet especially the insertions
-- Inserting data is super fast but retrieving is very slow

TreeSet:
--Sorts the data in natural order(ascending order)-- alphabetically or numerically
--It is the slowest when it comes to store the data

When to use which type of Set:
-If we don't care about insertion order and data being sorted
    --ALWAYS USE HASHSET

-If we need the insertion order
    --WE HAVE TO USE LINKEDHASHSET

-If we dont care about insertion order, but care about sorting data in natural order
   -- WE HAVE TO USE TREESET

LinkedHashSet                   vs                  TreeSet
-Insertion is fast                                -Slowest insertion
-Retrieval is super slow(slowest)                 - Retrieval is slower than HashSet but slower than faster than
                                                        LinkedHashSet
