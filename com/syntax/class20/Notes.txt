Constructors in Java:
    Constructors in Java are special block of code similar to methods that initiliaze objects of a class.

 Rules:
    1) They don't have return types not even void
    2) Name of the constructors must be same as the name of the class
    3) Constructors can't have non access modifiers like static, final, etc.
    4) We can use the access modifiers like public, private, protected with constructors
    5)If we don't write a constructor in a class a default constructor is provided by compiler
    6)We can have multiple constructors in a class, but their number of arguments, sequence of arguments, or type
    of arguments should be different.
    7)If we have multiple constructors then Java decides which constructor to call based on the parameters we pass.

this keyword:

    It is a keyword in java that we can use to refer to instance variables, methods, or constructors of a class

    1) "this" keyword is used to distinguish instance variable with local variable
    2) we can use "this" keyword to call the constructor of a class inside another constructor
    3) we can use "this" keyword to call the methods of a class

 Rules:

 1) this() should be first line inside a constructor
 2) this() can't be used inside methods
