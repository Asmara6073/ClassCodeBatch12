Access Modifiers in Java:
Access Modifiers allows us ot control the visibility of class members (fields,methods, constructors etc.) and classes
itself in Java.
There are 4 types of access levels and there are 3 keywords that we use to define these access levels.
Fourth level is applied when we don't use any access modifier keyword.
Levels from most restricted to less restricted are:
Private, Default, Protected, Public

Rules:
1)We should always prefer private access for the fields because the fields contain the data and the methods of your class
might use that data to perform some tasks. Checks before setting the values to these fields our classes and methods
might misbehave also the access of the data should be restricted so that not everyone can access the data.
2)We can't use access modifiers with local variables
==================================================
Constructors
Constructors in java allows us to set the values of the fields of a class.
    -They allow us to give initial values to the field of a class so we can protect data.
