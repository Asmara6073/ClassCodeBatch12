Inheritance in Java:
It's a mechanism in java through with a child class gets the properties and methods from a parent class
Benefits:
    1) Saves time to code
    2) Code duplication is reduced
    3)Execution time is faster
Disadvantages:
    Classes are tightly coupled if we change something in parent class it is also changed in the child class

Types of Inheritance:
    There are 4 types of inheritance but java only supports 3 of them
    1)single
    2)Hierarchical
    3)Multilivel
    4)Multiple(not supported in java)

 Single Inheritance:
    In single inheritance we only have one child and one parent class.

 Hierarchical Inheritance:
    In hierarchical inheritance we have a single parent class and multiple child classes

 Multilevel Inheritance:
    We have multiple levels of inheritance for example if we have classes A B C:
    Class C will be inherited from B and B will be inherited from A
