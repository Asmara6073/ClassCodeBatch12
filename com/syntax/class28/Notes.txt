Collections Framework in Java:
-- A collection of classes that help us manage and manipulate data in a better way
1)ArraysList
    1)This class has many built-in methods like
        -add()
        -remove()
        -clear()
     2) Dynamic and can adjust their size at run time

ArraysList Syntax:
    -ArrayList<> arrayList=new ArrayList

Wrapper Classes
byte->Byte
short-> Short
int-> Integer
double->Double
char->Character

Why Wrapper Classes
1) We get built-in methods
2) a lot of frameworks don't support primitives

When to use Primitive:
    -When we care about the memory because primitives occupy 4 times less memory as compared to wrappers
    -performance

When to use Wrapper
    -When we care about our ease
