Method overloading in Java:
   When same method name exists in a class but with different number of parameters
   or different data type of parameters or different sequence of parameters

 Advantages of method overloading:
   Flexibility of having same name
   End user gets the benefit that he does not need to remember different method name

  Rules:
    we can overload the constructors
    we can overload the static methods as well
    we can overload the main method as well

  Rules for Static Methods:
    Static methods can't access instance fields directly
    Instance methods can access instance as well static fields

  Method overriding:
    1) Method overriding happens when we have same name methods in the parent
        class and in the child class
    2) We can only override a method if we have inheritance relationship between
        two classes
    3) We can't override the private methods because they don't participate in inheritance
    4)We can't override the constructor because they don't participate in inheritance








   //review if else conditions
   // loops
   // methods(String class)
   // inheritance(just go through)
   // constructors and this keyword
   // access modifiers
   // types of variables
   // create an object of the class
