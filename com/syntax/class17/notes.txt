Types of variables
There are 3 types of variables: local, static, and instance

Local Variable: If a variable is defined inside a method, loop, or switch then it is called a local variable

Instance: If a variable is not declared inside a method,but it is inside a class, then it is called an instance variable
    -When the information is expected to be different from object to object
        We store that information in an instance variable.

Static: If a variable is not declared inside a method,but it is inside a class, and it has static keyword with it then
it is called a static variable
    - IF we know that a value will stay the same for all the object of a class, then we create a static variable for that


Class Vars{

int age; // instance variable
static double weight=25.5;// static variable

void method(){
String name="Moreed";// local variable
}


When to use which type of variable:
Local Variable:
    -Local variables should always be preferred over instance and static variables because they occupy the computer's
    memory for a very short amount of time as soon as their purpose is served Java destroys them.
   Pros- save memory
   Cons- not accessible outside of methods/block of code

Instance Variables:
    -When we want to share something in multiple methods of a class, and the information is expected to be different
    from object to object we should go with instance variables
   Pros- accessible in all the methods of a class
   Cons- occupy the computer's memory for longer than local variables

Static Variables:
    -When we know that information will stay the same for all the objects of a class we should create a static variable
    for that
   Pros- single memory location for all object of a class
   Cons- Stay longer in the memory, can only hold one value at a time
